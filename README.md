# vimium-colemak-mod-dh-keybindings
Keybindings to add to settings.json for Vimium on Colemak. <br/>
Note that this binding differs from the source binding of jooize where "n" is left, "e" is up, "i" is down, and "o" is right. You can view the original binding at https://github.com/jooize/vim-colemak.
I also include my own configs here.
